# nn-handwrite

## ann or mlp (artificial neural network or mutiple layer perceptron)
This package involves just one file "ann.py".You can execute "python ann/ann.py" directly or execute "lib/gen_data.py" first to see what the data for train looks like.
```
python ann/ann.py
```

## rnn
The first part of rnn is training a rnn-language-model.
```
python rnn_lm.py
```

将原来的代码改为python3，修复部分bug，
